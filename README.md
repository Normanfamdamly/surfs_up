# surfs_up - Module 9 Challenge

## Overview

W. Avy liked the intial analysis regarding my business plan for the Surf and Ice Cream show. Now he needs more data for the investors to digest before anymore investment can be made.  We need to make sure the average temp in June and Decemeber still hold true for a consistant flow into a Surf and Ice Cream shop.
