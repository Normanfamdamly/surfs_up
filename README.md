# surfs_up - Module 9 Challenge

## Overview

W. Avy liked the initial analysis regarding my business plan for the Surf and Ice Cream show. Now he needs more data for the investors to digest before any more investment can be made.  We need to make sure the average temp in June and Decemeber still hold true for a consistent flow into a Surf and Ice Cream shop.

## Temperature Results

The mean temperature for June and December is approximately 75 and 71 respectively.  Which is perfect for a Surf and Ice Cream shop even at the lowest points of the tourist seasons.

![Dec_Temps](https://github.com/Normanfamdamly/surfs_up/blob/main/Dec_Temps.png)
 
Both months are very similar when it comes to the max temperature, but they differ more when it comes to the minimum temperature. 
    -The Max Temp is 85 in June and 83 in December
    -The Min Temp is 64 in June and 56 in December
Based on temperature alone makes this is the ideal area for a Surf and Ice Cream shop.  You have the right temperature to bring in the surfers and bring in the ice cream eaters. 

## Summary

I would like to provide the W. Avy and the rest of the investors more analysis on the rain levels and the historical tides for Oahu, so they can have a complete picture of total weather of the area.  The rain levels will give us a better idea of how much outdoor time the locals and the tourist will spend at the ice cream shop. It will also give us a better understanding of the surfing usage of the store.  Combine that with the historical tides we will know if we have selected an area that is known for good waves and surfing.
